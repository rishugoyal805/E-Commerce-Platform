# E-Commerce System

This is a comprehensive and responsive e-commerce system implemented in C++ using vectors and other standard libraries. The system was developed as a second-year semester project, focusing on essential features for managing an online store.

## Features
 
- **User Authentication**: Secure login with a default username and password.
- **Product Management**: Add, remove, and manage products in the store.
- **Cart System**: Users can add products to a cart and manage their purchases.
- **Order Processing**: Handle orders from users with real-time updates.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

## File Structure

- **E-commerce.cpp**: The main file containing the entry point and core logic of the system.
- **input before running.txt**: Sample input file to initialize the system with products and other data.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Customization

- Modify `input before running.txt` to include different products or user data for testing.
- Adjust the code in `E-commerce.cpp` to add new features or improve existing functionality.

## Troubleshooting
